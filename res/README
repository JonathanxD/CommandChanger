This plugin is an command changer. With this API you can change any command label to another,
change command behavior or cancel command registration. To do that this plugins uses Reflection,
it may cause 'system breaks' if you try to reload this plugin.

This plugin will force dependency in PluginDescriptionFile of all plugins. If you try to unload
this plugin, Bukkit will try to unload ALL plugins.

Incompatibility issues: Bukkit doesn't expect command change, some plugins experience some issues.
If you are a plugin developer you can prevent command label change, see 'CommandChangePrevent',
but, an developer trying to change your command can register a 'enforcer'.

'@ChangeEnforce' is used to force change of '@ChangePrevent' commands, but, changing that commands
may break things.
